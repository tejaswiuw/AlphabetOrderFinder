# AlphabetOrderFinder

Java program to find the order of the alphabets based on a list of sorted words provided as input.


## Problem Statement:

You are given a list of words sorted in alphabetical order. The only issue is that this alphabet isnâ€™t English. Can you determine the ordering of the alphabet?

Note that you can assume this list of words has enough information to derive the complete order of the alphabet.

Sample input: ["bca", "aaa", "acb"]

Sample output: ['b', 'a', 'c']  

## Assumptions

Following assumptions were made while writing the program - 

- All the alphabet characters belong to the actual english alphabet set - 'a' to 'z' (irrespective of the order)
- All the alphabet characters are in lowercase
- If the input order is invalid, program returns an empty list of characters

## Test Cases

Following are some of the testcases that validates the correctness of the program - 

| Test Case      | Input (String Array)           | Output (List of Characters)  |
| :------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Null value as input     | null | [] |
| Empty array of words    | {} | [] |
| Array of empty strings    | {"",""} | [] |
| One of the input words is null | {"abc", null} | [] |
| Array of words with a word followed by its prefix (invalid input)| {"foo","fo"}     |   [] |
| Incomplete array of words with one word (invalid input)| {"git"}     |   (any order of characters) |
| Incomplete array of words with length more than 1 (invalid input)| {"itg", "tig"}     |   (any order of characters) |
| Array of words with complete information (valid input) | {"bca", "aaa", "acb"} |    ['b', 'a', 'c'] |
